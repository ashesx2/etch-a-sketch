## The Odin Project | Foundations
**Project: Etch-A-Sketch**

A browser version of an etch-a-sketch created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently, you can change the size of the grid and change the grid from white to black. May add more options in the future like choosing different colors, having random colors, etc.
